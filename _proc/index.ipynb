    "## Background and alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no reliable way of downloading an image of a Trove newspaper article from the web interface. The image download option produces an HTML page with embedded images, and the article is often sliced into pieces to fit the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package includes tools to download articles as complete JPEG images. If an article is printed across multiple newspaper pages, multiple images will be downloaded â€“ one for each page. It's intended for integration into other tools and processing workflows, or for people who like working on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want to quickly download an article as an image without installing anything, you can [use this web app](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image) in the GLAM Workbench. To download images of all articles returned by a search in Trove, you can also use the [Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/).\n",
